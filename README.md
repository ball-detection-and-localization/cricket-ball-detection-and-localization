Cricket ball detection and localization

This is a complete set of codes that allow a beginner to start coding and progress upto being able to detect and predict ball paths and 
view an image from a diffrent angle.

All folders have the required images and videos in order to work ,the order of checking out the folders is as follows:

  "edge detection"    (with and without using thresholding)

  "ball colour from image"

  "colour_and_object_detection"

  "image_transforms(homography)"
  
  "paint tool"
  
  "detect where ball pitched"  (both indoores and outdoors)
  
  "ball locolization single image"
  
there are additional codes such as finding frames and other helper codes located in "video_tools", "extera_test_codes" and "video_to_image"
